 CRO_discouragement_of_joining_army: "Discouragement of Joining the Army"
 CRO_discouragement_of_joining_army_desc: "\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_CRO_discouragement_of_joining_army_texticon \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the end of the Great War in 1918, the Croatians are discouraged from joining the Royal Yugoslav Army due to political and ethnic tensions. The army, dominated by Serbs, is seen as a tool of central control, suppressing Croatian political and cultural aspirations. Many Croats view military service as reinforcing Serbian dominance rather than serving a unified state. Repression of Croatian nationalist movements and the lack of Croatian representation in the army deepen resentment. As a result, many Croatians avoid enlistment, fueling desires for autonomy and eventual independence."
